    "Q1. Discuss string slicing and provide examples.\n",
    "Ans. String slicing is a technique in python used to extract specific portion from a string. It uses the format : string[start : end]\n",
    "where start is the index from where slicing starts and end is the index where slicing ends. But the end index is exclusive. It can be illustrated with the help of following code :  "

    "Ans. The key features of lists in python are : \n",
    "1.Ordered collection : Lists are ordered collection of elements. Items are stored in a proper order and can be accessed by their index.\n",
    "2.Mutable : Lists are mutable which means modifications can be made to lists even after they have been created. We can either add or remove the elemnts from it.\n",
    "3.Heterogenous elements : Lists can store elements of different data types such as integers , strings , float values , even other sub lists .\n",
    "4.Supports slicing : Lists supports slicing which helps in extracting specific and required data or elements.\n",
    "5.Supports Iteratin : Lists can be iterated using loops , which also increases efficiency and helps in performing various operatins.\n",
    "6.List Comprehension : Python support list comprehension enabling concise and readable creation of new lists based on existing ones."
